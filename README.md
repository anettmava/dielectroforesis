Simulation of dielectrophoresis using MATLAB
Modeling of the behavior of erythrocytes in an electric field, using dielectrophoresis, a process that allows manipulating biological and non-biological particles by applying an electric field.
The electric field generated by positively and negatively charged electrodes is simulated, and the trajectory of erythrocytes through this field is modeled. The electric field is calculated both with and without a potential gradient, and the interaction of the particles with the charged plates is plotted. Erythrocytes move depending on the electric force they experience, which allows to know the probability of malaria infection depending on the trajectory.

Functionalities
Electric field calculation: Simulates the electric field in a region of space with different configurations of charges.
Erythrocyte motion modeling: Integrates the movement of erythrocytes according to the dielectrophoresis force and their charge.
Provides plots of the electric field, potential distribution and particle trajectory in the field.
Infection probability analysis: Evaluates the probability of infection of an erythrocyte based on its trajectory through the electric field.
